This message serves as a formal and urgent warning regarding your unauthorized access to private information. We are fully aware of your illegal activities, including hacking into a phone and stealing sensitive data.

Under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) 2016, your actions are classified as serious cybercrimes, which carry severe penalties including imprisonment and substantial fines. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) is currently monitoring all suspicious activities, and we have gathered enough evidence to initiate legal proceedings against you.

For your reference, the relevant sections of PECA include:

Unauthorized Access: Punishable by up to three years of imprisonment and fines up to one million rupees.

We strongly advise you to cease all illegal activities immediately. Return all stolen data and refrain from further unauthorized access. Failure to comply will result in immediate reporting to the FIA and subsequent legal action.

Your cooperation in this matter will be in your best interest.

Sincerely,

Your motherfucking mom
